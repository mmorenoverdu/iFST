# Imagined Finger Sequence Task (iFST) | Coming soon...

Repository with the materials for an open-source version of the Finger Sequence Task (FST) for local and online use. These versions have been tested as in Moreno-Verdú et. al 2025 (in preparation). Subsequent updates in native software (PsychoPy: https://www.psychopy.org/) may need adjustments. As developers, we are not responsible for implementing these in every use case.

The repository will have two main folders, which contain PsychoPy experiments (.psyexp) and associated files to be able to run them locally or online. Please consult the Readme files for each version before using them (local and online versions are NOT equivalent). The Readme files contain extensive documentation on the most relevant experiment settings and detailed information to allow the user further customization.

The files and code that will be provided are fixed in terms of the task parameters (e.g., number and type of sequences, number of trials, trial-to-trial feedback, etc.). Future versions will allow flexible customization. 

Language expansions will be done relatively easily thanks to the implementation of language localisations (please read each Readme to understand how to implement these).
